    <h2>This butterscotch budino is next-level !</h2>
    <p> I'm gonna show you my take on this amazing Italian custard pudding. Above and beyond that rich and decadent
        butterscotch flavor, the texture of this budino is unbelievable. To say it's smooth and luxurious doesn't come
        close to doing it justice. Serve as is, with whipped cream, or topped with caramel sauce and flaky</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup packed dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>¾ cup milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white rum</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine brown sugar, salt, and water in a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan and place over medium-high heat.
            Bring to a boil; cook until caramel is very dark, and bubbles appear, 7 to 10 minutes. Immediately turn off
            the heat.</li>
        <li>Carefully whisk in 2 tablespoons butter; pour in heavy cream and continue to stir. Be careful, as mixture
            may boil up in the pan. Stir over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves. Whisk in milk.</li>
        <li>Whisk whole egg, egg yolks, and 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon cornstarch together in a mixing bowl. Slowly
            whisk in 1 cup of hot cream mixture to temper egg mixture. Whisk egg mixture into the saucepan and increase
            heat to medium-high. Bring to a simmer, and cook, whisking, until mixture thickens, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and pour into a fine-mesh strainer set over a bowl to remove any lumps. Whisk in rum.</li>
        <li>Pour into serving glasses. Let cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes, before wrapping in plastic wrap
            and refrigerating until thoroughly chilled, 3 to 4 hours.</li>
    </ol>
